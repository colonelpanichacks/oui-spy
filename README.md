## OUIs

Looking for manufacturer prefixes?  
ðŸ‘‰ **Check the full list here:** [OUI List (`ouis.md`)](https://github.com/colonelpanichacks/ouispy-detector/blob/main/ouis.md)  
Gotta catch â€™em all â€” contribute your findings!

If you need to verify an OUI, use one of these lookup tools:

- **Official IEEE OUI Lookup:** [https://standards.ieee.org/products-services/regauth/oui/index.html](https://standards.ieee.org/products-services/regauth/oui/index.html)
- **Alternate OUI Lookup:** [https://macaddress.io/](https://macaddress.io/)
